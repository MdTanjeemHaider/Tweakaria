Tweakaria is a simple quality of life mod for [tModLoader](https://www.tmodloader.net/), a modloader for the game [Terraria](https://terraria.org/). Developed initially for private use among me and my friends, this mod offers quality of life improvements to certain aspects of the game.

Inspired by other popular quality of life mods like "[imkSushi's](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2828041071)" and "[LuiAFK](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/luiafk-unlimited-combinable-potions-autobuilding-stuff-and-more.58806/)," Tweakaria aims to enhance the Terraria experience by addressing common pain points and adding convenient features.

### Features

* **Infinite Variants for Ammo:** Tweakaria introduces infinite variants for arrows, bullets darts, solutions and other ammo types, so you never run out of ammo in the middle of a boss fight.
* **Melting Recipes:** Melt you old armours, weapons, tools and other items back into bars (melting returns 80% of the materials used to craft the item). You can also melt bars back into ores with 100% return.
* **Exchange Recipes:** Don't like that your world only has gold? After you purchase the "Alteration Orb" from the merchant you can start exchanging ores and bars of the same tier. You can also exchange between a few other items that are similar to each other (check notes!).
* **Craft Previously Unobtainable Items:** You can now craft items that were previously not craftable. No more farming for that biome key with 0.04% drop chance.

**Note:** I highly reccomend using the [recipe browser](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2619954303) mod alongside Tweakaria as it will provide access to all of the recipes without having to go to the guide NPC.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release of Tweakaria from the Github [releases](https://github.com/MdTanjeemHaider/Tweakaria/releases) page.
2. Locate your mod folder. The default path is usually "Documents/My Games/Terraria/tModLoader/Mods".
3. Move the downloaded ".tmod" file into the mod folder.
4. Launch tModLoader and enable the mod.

### Why isn't Tweakaria available on the tModloader Browser?

You might have noticed that Tweakaria is not listed on the official tModloader Browser. The mod is currently published exclusively for my friends on the Steam Workshop.

While I understand that many players prefer the convenience of the tModloader Browser, I have chosen not to make it public as the workshop version is subject to frequent changes that may negatively impact the game balance. However, I will continue to update the mod here with any meaningful addtions and improvements that enchance the gameplay without compromising the overall balance of the game.

Please note that I may make Tweakaria public on the Steam Workshop in the future if I feel that the mod has reached a state of completion and proper balance.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.
